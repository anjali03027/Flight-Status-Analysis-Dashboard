Description of the project-
Comprehensive Flight Status Monitoring:
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor and analyze the performance of various airlines, including on-time performance, delays, and cancellations.

Detailed Airline Performance Insights:
Utilized a dataset containing flight data such as departure times, days of the week, and monthly performance metrics to provide a thorough analysis of each airline's operational efficiency.

Trend Analysis and Data Visualization:
Implemented various charts and visualizations to depict trends in flight delays, cancellations, and average delay times across different periods, enabling stakeholders to identify patterns and make data-driven decisions.

Interactive Filtering and Slicing:
Enabled dynamic filtering and slicing of data by airline, time period, and other relevant dimensions to allow users to drill down into specific details and compare performance metrics across different airlines and time frames.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Conducted extensive data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and reliability, including handling missing values and standardizing data formats, to create a robust and user-friendly dashboard.
